# Backend server for code execution

This is a Python Fast Api API that handles code compilation

To run the server you will probably start with a venv:

```shell
    python -m venv venv
```

Then you will need to activate the venv by running the command:
```shell
    . .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

To deactivate the venv run:
```shell
    deactivate
```

Once the venv is running and all the dependencies are installed 
you should be able to run the API in reload mode:

```shell
    uvicorn main:app --reload
```# backend-server
# backend-server
# backend-server
